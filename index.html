## Welcome to Bigscience2007â€™s GitHub page.

Here I will list the projects I am working on. 

### Random dance move generator
This is a one pager with minimal styling that generates a random dance move every 15 seconds.  It gives you a three second warning that the move is about to change. The dance moves are swing/jazz style moves.  I have used this in my garage for getting some cardio.
